# Design For Six Sigma

This project is an extra addition to my Green Belt project for Honeywell.

## About

###Test decision codes (TDCs)### are simple yet time consuming process that determines if a sample of a part needs to be tested or not. The Quality Engineer determines if a part needs a TDC is needed and the inspectors needs to wait until the QE gives the decision. However, some circumstances can put a hardstop on the process and the QE is not able to give a quick answer, hence the slow progress down at the plant. So, this program is intended to eliminate that hardstop and have the inspectors make a quick decision based on what the program says.

## Solution
So, does this mean QEs are not going to determine TDCs? No, QEs still have to determine them, but this will eliminate the need to wait for a packet review, giving less work for the SES. This program will have all the information entered ahead of time by the QE and each time the part goes through the plant, the inspector or the QE can go into the program, enter information regarding to the part, and enter TDC Yes or No so next time the inspector or operator goes into the program, they can see decision right away
